// prob126: Word Ladder II

/*
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time
 * Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
 * Note:
 * Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
 * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
 * You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
