// prob1375: Bulb Switcher III

/*
 * There is a room with n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.
 * At moment k (for k from 0 to n - 1), we turn on the light[k] bulb. A bulb change color to blue only if it is on and all the
 * previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.
 * Return the number of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue.

/*
 * Constraints:
 * n == light.length
 * 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * light is a permutation of  [1, 2, ..., n]
