// prob1335: Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

/*
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
 * Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
 * Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
 * The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
 * Example 2:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
 * Example 3:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
 * Example 4:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
 * Output: 15
 * Example 5:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
 * Output: 843

/*
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
 * 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
 * 1 <= d <= 10
