// prob499: The Maze III

/*
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by
 * rolling up (u), down (d), left (l) or right (r), but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall.
 * When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze.
 * The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.
 * Given the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the ball could drop into the hole by moving the shortest distance.
 * The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included).
 * Output the moving directions by using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest ways, you
 * should output the lexicographically smallest way. If the ball cannot reach the hole, output "impossible".
 * The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the
 * borders of the maze are all walls. The ball and the hole coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 1 1 0 0 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 1 0 0 1
 * 0 1 0 0 0
 * Input 2: ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
 * Input 3: hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (0, 1)
 * Output: "lul"

/*
 * Example 2:
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 1 1 0 0 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 1 0 0 1
 * 0 1 0 0 0
 * Input 2: ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
 * Input 3: hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (3, 0)
 * Output: "impossible"
 * Explanation: The ball cannot reach the hole.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * There is only one ball and one hole in the maze.
 * Both the ball and hole exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same position initially.
 * The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
 * The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and the width and the height of the maze won't exceed 30.
