// prob265: Paint House II

/*
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of
 * painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two
 * adjacent houses have the same color.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of
 * painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
 */

/*
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;
 *              Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

/*
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
