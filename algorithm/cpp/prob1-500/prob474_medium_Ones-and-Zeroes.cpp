// prob474: Ones and Zeroes

/*
 * In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.
 * For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.
 * Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
 * The size of given string array won't exceed 600.
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
