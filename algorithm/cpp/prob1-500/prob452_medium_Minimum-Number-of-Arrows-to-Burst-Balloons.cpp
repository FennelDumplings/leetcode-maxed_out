// prob452: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

/*
 * There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon,
 * provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal,
 * y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice.
 * Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis.
 * A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend.
 * There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely.
 * The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
 */

/*
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
 * Output:
 * 2
 * Explanation:
 * One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
