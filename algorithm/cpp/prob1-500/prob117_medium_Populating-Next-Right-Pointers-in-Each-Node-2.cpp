// prob117: Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

/*
 * Given a binary tree
 * struct Node {
 *   int val;
 *   Node *left;
 *   Node *right;
 *   Node *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 */

/*
 * Follow up:
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 */

/*
 * Constraints:
 * The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
 * -100Â <= node.val <= 100
