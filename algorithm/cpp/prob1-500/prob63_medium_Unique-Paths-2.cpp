// prob63: Unique Paths II

/*
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * [
 *   [0,0,0],
 *   [0,1,0],
 *   [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * Output: 2
