// prob68: Text Justification

/*
 * Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters
 * and is fully (left and right) justified.
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.
 * Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line
 * do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
 * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
 * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
 * The input array words contains at least one word.
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
 * maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 *    "This    is    an",
 *    "example  of text",
 *    "justification.  "
 * ]
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
 * maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 *   "What   must   be",
 *   "acknowledgment  ",
 *   "shall be        "
 * ]
 * Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
 *              because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
 *              Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
 * Example 3:
 * Input:
 * words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
 *          "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
 * maxWidth = 20
 * Output:
 * [
 *   "Science  is  what we",
 *   "understand      well",
 *   "enough to explain to",
 *   "a  computer.  Art is",
 *   "everything  else  we",
 *   "do                  "
 * ]
