// prob292: Nim Game

/*
 * You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of
 * you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner.
 * You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
 * Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether
 * you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
