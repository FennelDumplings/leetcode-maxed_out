// prob337: house-robber

/*
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area,
 * called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart
 * thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the
 * police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
 * Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
 *      3
 *     / \
 *    2   3
 *     \   \
 *      3   1
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
 *      3
 *     / \
 *    4   5
 *   / \   \
 *  1   3   1
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
