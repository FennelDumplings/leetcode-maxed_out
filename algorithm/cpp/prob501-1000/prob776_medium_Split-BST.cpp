// prob776: Split BST

/*
 * Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with root node root, and a target value V, split the tree into two subtrees 
 * where one subtree has nodes that are all smaller or equal to the target value, while the other subtree has all nodes that are
 * greater than the target value.  It's not necessarily the case that the tree contains a node with value V.
 * Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain.  Formally, for any child C with parent P in the
 * original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after the split, then node C should still have the parent P.
 * You should output the root TreeNode of both subtrees after splitting, in any order.
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,5,7], V = 2
 * Output: [[2,1],[4,3,6,null,null,5,7]]
 * Explanation:
 * Note that root, output[0], and output[1] are TreeNode objects, not arrays.
 * The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,5,7] is represented by the following diagram:
 *           4
 *         /   \
 *       2      6
 *      / \    / \
 *     1   3  5   7
 * while the diagrams for the outputs are:
 *           4
 *         /   \
 *       3      6      and    2
 *             / \           /
 *            5   7         1
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * The size of the BST will not exceed 50.
 * The BST is always valid and each node's value is different.
