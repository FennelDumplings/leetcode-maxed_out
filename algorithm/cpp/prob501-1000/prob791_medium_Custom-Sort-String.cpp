// prob791: Custom Sort String

/*
 * S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.
 * S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted.
 * More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
 * Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
 */

/*
 * Example :
 * Input:
 * S = "cba"
 * T = "abcd"
 * Output: "cbad"
 * Explanation:
 * "a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
 * Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
 * T has length at most 200.
 * S and T consist of lowercase letters only.
