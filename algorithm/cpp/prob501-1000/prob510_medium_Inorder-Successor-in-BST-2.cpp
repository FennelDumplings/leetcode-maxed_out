// prob510: Inorder Successor in BST II

/*
 * Given a node in a binary search tree, findÂ the in-order successor of that node in the BST.
 * If that node has no in-order successor, returnÂ null.
 * The successor of a nodeÂ is the node with the smallest key greater than node.val.
 * You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree.
 * Each node will have a reference to its parent node.Â Below is the definition for Node:

        if(!node) return nullptr;
        if(node -> right)
