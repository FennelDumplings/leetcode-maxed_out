// prob729: My Calendar I

/*
 * Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
 * Your class will have the method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
 * A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)
 * For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 * Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)
 */

/*
 * Example 1:
 * MyCalendar();
 * MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
 * MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
 * MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
 * Explanation:
 * The first event can be booked.  The second can't because time 15 is already booked by another event.
 * The third event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
 */

/*
 * Note:
 * The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
 * In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].
