// prob701: Insert into a Binary Search Tree

/*
 * Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST.
 * Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.
 * Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion.
 * You can return any of them.
 */

/*
 * For example, 
 * Given the tree:
 *         4
 *        / \
 *       2   7
 *      / \
 *     1   3
 * And the value to insert: 5
 * You can return this binary search tree:
 *          4
 *        /   \
 *       2     7
 *      / \   /
 *     1   3 5
 * This tree is also valid:
 *          5
 *        /   \
 *       2     7
 *      / \
 *     1   3
 *          \
 *           4
